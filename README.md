Important Note: Makes sure you run this using Python3.9 because for whatever reason it crashes in 3.12 if you are trying
to run older versions of the game

# Summary
This was my third iteration on an endless platformer. My first two I abandoned after only working on them for around
6 hours. This was my first "large-scale" project. Part of this code made its way into my game engine that I build from
scratch. My senior year of high school I would make another version of this code that worked a lot better. It had original
pixel art! I started working on this project with my cousin, Solomon. He, however, quit pretty early in the project and
had minimal contributions (less then 1% of code base).


# Bug Fixes 11/27/2023
- Fixed some deceleration and collision code (minor, but important changes)
- Reinstated the endless platformer code (uncommented code and deleted quick test code)

# Monumental Commits
### Generation of enemies and platforms: 02/01/2021
commit d0e5d53715a2e645761a2bc7cee73b76727c3995

This was the last commit I made before I stopped working on the project for over four months. It was still a working 
game, but was quite buggy. Platform generation worked, collisions worked mostly, and jumping was still pretty glitchy. 
The overall feel of the game was quite good at this point though and it feels very nostalgic to look at - not very polished, 
but still was fun

### Bug Fixes, Scoring, etc.
