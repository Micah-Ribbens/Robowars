# Summary
This was my third iteration on an endless platformer. My first two I abandoned after only working on them for around
6 hours. This was my first "large-scale" project. Part of this code made its way into my game engine that I build from
scratch. My senior year of high school I would make another version of this code that worked a lot better. It had original
pixel art! I started working on this project with my cousin, Solomon. He, however, quit pretty early in the project and
had minimal contributions (less then 1% of code base).


# Bug Fixes 11/27/2023
- Fixed some deceleration and collision code (minor, but important changes)
- Reinstated the endless platformer code (uncommented code and deleted quick test code)
